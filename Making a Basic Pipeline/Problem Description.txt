Context
Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients is growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

Individuals with diabetes face a risk of developing some secondary health issues such as heart diseases and nerve damage. Thus, early detection and treatment of diabetes can prevent complications and assist in reducing the risk of severe health problems. Even though it's incurable, it can be managed by treatment and medication.

Researchers at the Bio-Solutions lab want to get better understanding of this disease among women and are planning to use machine learning models that will help them to identify patients who are at risk of diabetes.

We will use pima indians diabetes dataset to see how to use pipeline and make_pipeline
