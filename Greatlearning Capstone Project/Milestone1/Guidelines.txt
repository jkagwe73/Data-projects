The first milestone report must describe the data and align it to the analytical problems the Capstone Project addresses. It should also include the rationale of the project - why is the problem important and what value it will add to the company. It should also include data pre-processing and findings from the exploratory data analysis after data pre-processing and should lay out the plan of action, with an approach, for the model-building phase of the project. The notes must include the design of the project and the analytical methodology you think will be appropriate for the project.

The following points are expected to be included in the first milestone report:

Introduction
Define the problem statement
Need of the present study
Business/social opportunities
Data Report
Understand the data collection methodology - comment on how the data might have been collected
Overview of data - check the rows, columns, variable info, and descriptive details
Data pre-processing
Removal of unwanted variables
Missing value treatment
Outlier treatment
Variable transformation
Addition of new variables
Exploratory Data Analysis
Univariate Analysis - distribution and spread for continuous and categorical variables
Bivariate Analysis - relationships between different variables
Insightful visualizations
Analytical Approach
Mention the alternative analytical approaches that you may see fit to be applied to the problem
 

Submission Guidelines
Please note that the submission consists of two parts - a business report and a Python notebook.

Business Report:

The report should be submitted as a PDF file (.pdf) and NOT as a document (.docx)
The report should be made keeping in mind that the audience will be a business leader like CMO, COO, or Data Science Manager.
Copying and pasting code from the Python notebook is not a good idea and it is better to avoid showing codes unless they are the focal point of the report considering the audience this business report is for.
The report should contain observations and insights based on the analysis performed
The report should be crisp and to the point, highlighting the key takeaways so far
Python Notebook:

The notebook should be submitted as an HTML file (.html) and NOT as a notebook file (.ipynb)
The conversion from a .ipynb file to a .html file can be done via code or free online tools
The final notebook should be well-documented, with inline comments explaining the functionality of code and markdown cells containing comments on the observations and insights
The notebook should be run from start to finish in a sequential manner before submission
All warnings and errors should be removed before submission
